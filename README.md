# LOST

A platformer game where you collect fingers and jump between platforms.

_Feeling lost, a feeling many are familiar with and one that we hope to capture with our game... throughout the game, a hand works through different levels and starts to find itself.
The hand originally starts off fingerless and helpless in the dark and works through levels- gaining fingers, strength, confidence, and finding itself as it progresses.
The hand originally starts off fingerless and helpless in the dark and works through levels- gaining fingers, strength, confidence, and finding itself as it progresses.
Once the first level is completed, the second level will earn the player a finger- symbolizing the beginning of finding hope. This will allow the hand to hop. This will be a bit faster and let it go to higher grounds. This level will have a lighter background/let the hand have more light around it.
In the next level, the hand has gained two fingers, allowing it to run/walk. Yet again, more light shines, and the hand is making progress- discovering what it can do and starting to explore its capabilities.
Now, the hand has gained three fingers, this allows it to move with more power and hold onto platforms
When the hand is at four fingers. it’s almost at its strongest and can pull itself up higher and reach more and more places on the map.
At five fingers, the hand is at its strongest power and van jump further and run faster. At this stage, the hand has a bit of time to explore it’s capabilities and then...
At five fingers, the hand is at its strongest power and van jump further and run faster. At this stage, the hand has a bit of time to explore it’s capabilities and then...
The boss fight. The hand will fight an evil version of itself. If it wins: win screen! If it looses: it falls down to the start
In the end, this is all basically a metaphor for feeling lost and learning to find your place in your community/what you want your future to be._
